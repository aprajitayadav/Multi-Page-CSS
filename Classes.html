<div class="paragraph" style="display:block;"><font size="5">At Magical Finger's&rsquo;s Art <em>all</em> children are artists, and all children will find success. We focus all of our art projects around a process oriented approach. Our instructors strive to show the children the joy of being creative by zeroing in on developing the skills used in the creative process. Each child will leave the studio with projects that are unique to them and their experience in class. In a particular class the instruction may be in drawing or painting a fish. Every student will leave with a picture of a fish, but they will all look different and be unique to that child.</font></div>

<div class="paragraph"><font size="5">Typically a child will sign up for a session or period of instruction that will last a designated number classes. The class or camp will meet on a particular day and all art projects will revolve around the course theme. Children will enjoy getting to know the other students and teachers as they see the same faces each time they come to Magical Finger's's Art children's art center. Class lengths vary with age to accommodate their needs and abilities.</font><br /></div>
